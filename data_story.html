            A data-driven guide to help you choose a television that saves money,
            reduces environmental impact, and meets your entertainment needs.

            Buying a television isn't just about screen size, picture quality, or smart features.
            <strong>Energy efficiency matters</strong> - both for your wallet and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Australian households watching an average of 5.5 hours of TV daily, the difference
            between an efficient and inefficient model can mean <strong>$50-100 in annual savings</strong>.
            Over a TV's 7-10 year lifespan, that's $500-1,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            This story explores how screen technology, size, star ratings, and brand choices
            influence energy consumption - giving you the insights to make a smart purchase decision.

          <h3>💡 What This Means for You</h3>
          <p>
            LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology uses approximately <strong>20% less power</strong> 
            than older LCD models. LED-backlit screens are now the industry standard and dominate 
            the market for good reason - they're more efficient and often deliver better picture quality.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem">
            <strong>Shopping tip:</strong> Specifically ask for "LED" or "LED-backlit" TVs. 
            If a retailer only lists "LCD," ask whether it uses LED backlighting. Avoid older 
            CCFL-backlit LCD models unless heavily discounted.

        <div class="chart-insight fade-in-up">
          <p>
            <strong>32-43 inch TVs dominate the market</strong>, making up the majority of available models. 
            This size range is popular because it suits most living rooms and bedrooms while remaining 
            energy-efficient. Very large screens (65 inches and above) represent a smaller portion of 
            the market, typically targeting premium segments.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem">
            The abundance of mid-sized models means more competition, better prices, and more efficient 
            options to choose from. If you don't genuinely need a large screen, staying in the 32-55 inch 
            range gives you the best selection of energy-efficient models.

        <div class="insight-box fade-in-up">
          <h3>💡 Key Finding: Yes, But With Important Exceptions</h3>
          <p>
            The scatter plot reveals a <strong>positive correlation</strong> between screen size and 
            power consumption - larger TVs generally use more electricity. However, notice the spread 
            of data points: some efficient large models consume less power than poorly designed smaller ones.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem">
            <strong>What this tells us:</strong> Technology and design matter as much as size. A well-designed 
            55-inch LED TV with a 5-star rating can use less power than a 43-inch model with older technology 
            and a 2-star rating. When comparing TVs, always check both the size AND the actual wattage - 
            don't assume bigger automatically means higher bills.

        <div class="insight-box fade-in-up">
          <h3>💡 The Sweet Spot for Efficiency</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>4-5 star ratings are most common in mid-sized TVs</strong> (approximately 32-55 inches). 
            This makes sense: smaller screens require less power to illuminate, making it easier for 
            manufacturers to achieve high efficiency ratings.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem">
            For large screens (65 inches and above), expect lower star ratings due to the physics 
            of powering more LEDs across a bigger area. However, <strong>comparing models within the 
            same size category</strong> can still reveal 30-40W differences between the best and worst options.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="data-note fade-in-up">
          ⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> A 3-star 55-inch TV isn't necessarily "bad" - it's rated 
          relative to other TVs of similar size. What matters is choosing the highest rating available 
          in your preferred size category. Even one extra star can save $15-25 annually.

          <p>
            Brand averages reveal significant differences: <strong>CAIXUN and ENGLAON</strong> record 
            the lowest average power consumption (around 50W), while <strong>YOKOHAMA</strong> shows 
            the highest (approximately 110W). This represents more than a 50% difference in energy use.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:1rem">
            However, these are averages across each brand's entire product line. A brand with high 
            average consumption might still offer some efficient models, and vice versa. Use these 
            figures as a starting point, but always verify the specific model's Energy Rating Label.
